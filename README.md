# Image Scraper
A console application which scrapes the images from a html page at a given URL into a specified directory.  I wrote this project to demonstrate my C# coding style for potential employers.  The style I used is meant to be representative of my professional coding.

## Libraries/tools used
NuGet for package management
CsQuery for html parsing
NUnit for unit testing
Moq for mocking
